# random-walk

Basically, our turtle making random movements North, East, South, or West, each time it progresses by the same distance, but it can at any point choose which direction it wants to go out of the four. The color palette was kept from the challange (million-dolar). I've just applied it to the random walk so that each time it walks, it's going to pick a different color.
